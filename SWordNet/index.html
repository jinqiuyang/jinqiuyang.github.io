<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
We make publicly available manually verified semantically related words (referred to as rPairs) in order for other people to:
<ul>
  <li> Check our results, in the spirit of any scientific work.
  <li> Provide a software version of WordNet and share with the research community.
</ul>

<p>

We have chosen to publish the correct rPairs by manual verification in our MSR'12 paper. 


<hr size="4">
<h2> Data </h2>
<p>
In each rPair file, Column 1&2 are a pair of words, Column 3 shows the one of the five category (synonym, antonym, near antonym, related, identifier, please refer to <a href="https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~lintan/publications/rpair-msr12.pdf" target=_blank>our MSR'12 paper</a> for more details). Column 4&+ shows the context where this rPair is discovered.
<p>
The stopword list used in the experiment is <a href="rPairs/stoplist.txt" target=_blank>here</a>.<br>
rPair files can be found in the following links:
<ul>
	<li> the Linux kernel: &nbsp;<a href="rPairs/linux_c_100.csv" target=_blank>comment</a> &nbsp;<a href="rPairs/linux_id_100.csv" target=_blank>code</a> &nbsp;<a href="rPairs/linux_cc_100.csv" target=_blank>comment-code</a></li>
